    <h1>ACME Product Recall -<br />Dehydrated Boulders</h1>
    <p><b>The ACME Toy Company</b> is asking all customers to return any <i>Dehydrated Boulders</i> purchased in the month of March 2004.</p>
    <p>Because of a fault at our manufacturing plant, the boulder would not form when the user adds water as per instructions. Therefore these items carry great risk of flattening user.</p>
